Honestly this will be my first post to my own blog which is kind of cool. All giddy-ness aside, I want to show you how you can easily get a ðŸ”¥**free Okta Developer environment**ðŸ”¥.

## Okta Developer For Free

3 - After you set up your password, you will be logged into your own Dev Okta Admin Page, with a full suite of User, Group, and App tools ðŸ˜²! You iz Okta Adminz nowz.

With that you can do some neat stuff like:

- Generate an API token and take it over to Postman
- Create some test SAML apps
- Create some fake users and groups and play with Security Flows

Well that's my quick and short first blog! I want to make this part of a series for how to setup a SAML and SCIM integration with Okta. More to come. âœŒ
