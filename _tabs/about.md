## Why I Started This Blog

![solve](https://i.imgflip.com/7ozrsm.jpg)

Saying IT is a massive field is an understatement. There is a crazy vast amount to learn and to explore, and depending what interests you, you can make a decent lucrative career out of it\* (emphasis on the asterisks)

After being a general hardware IT for a the first few years in my career, I wanted to transition over to programming and automating IT system admin stuff, but a lot of some basic IT admin knowledge is just kind of missing from the internet. Google searches are seldomly useful if you can find the right place, and sometimes e a lot of knowledge is gate kept by `<place your relatable thing here>` or you have to literally go through the process of purchasing a new system and sit with a vendor to learn something new.

Now with sources like ChatGPT out in the wild, maybe some of the knowledge gap has been filled, which is AWESOME. _But_ sometimes AI just gets stuff wrong. Try asking ChatGPT to show you how to do something complex on an app you administer that is not well documented and it will spew out some hallucinegic nonsense.

Hopefully here you can take a tidbit or two of knowledge nuggets with you on your IT journey. I know I wish I had someone showing me the ropes while I was learning to be a better IT tech.
